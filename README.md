### Participatory Economy Network


The intention of the PEN project is to provide an implementation of a decentralized network of participatory economy.

#### PEN construction

The basis of PEN is a decentralized peer-to-peer [network](https://github.com/pallocate/kad). Access to the network will be for participants only. and will be controlled through authentication. This is called friend-to-friend networking.

On top of the network different functionalities are added like the voting block chain and the crypto credit block chain. These functionalities and others will be available as [plugins](https://github.com/pallocate/plugins). 

It was originally intended for the Java Virtual Machine, but focus has shifted to building native binaries like web assembly. It builds natively to but isÂ´nt very useful as of yet. Other stuff that needs to be done is authentication and block chain logic of top of the P2P Network. 

There is also a [tender editor](https://github.com/pallocate/tedit) and a simple [simulator](https://github.com/pallocate/simulator) for testing the network.
