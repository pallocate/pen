### Participatory Economy Network


The intention of the PEN project is to provide an implementation of a decentralized network of participatory economy.

#### PEN construction

The basis of PEN is a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Access to the network will be for participants only. and will be controlled through authentication. This is called friend-to-friend networking.

On top of the network different functionalities are added like the voting block chain and the crypto credit block chain. These functionalities and a lots of other will be available to a user as [plugins](https://github.com/pallocate/plugins). 

A variety of plugins is intended to help facilitate the iterative planning process of a participatory economy. Such as proposal handling and building planning tree data structures, as well as information sharing and messaging.

A lot of stuff needs to be done yet, like authentication and block chain logic of top of the P2P Network. Integration between differen parts of the project etc.
