## *Participatory Economy Network*


The intention of the PEN project is to provide an implementation of a decentralized network for participatory economy.

**PEN construction**

The basis for the PEN project is a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

Access to the network will only be for participants and will be controlled through authentication. The technical term for this is F2F or a friend-to-friend network.

On top of the network different functionalities are added like the votation block chain and the crypto credit block chain. These functionalities and a lots of other will be available to a user as plugins. 

A variety of plugins is intended to help facilitate the iterative planning process of a participatory economy. Such as taking care of proposal handling and building planning tree data structures, as well as information sharing and messaging.
