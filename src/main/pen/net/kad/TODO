Integration
   Integration with the rest of the project

Authentication
   Authentication is required on top of kademlia to build the f2f network

Security
   API, audit control flow, exceptions, validate inputs

Coroutines
   It would be better to rewrite the kademlia network using nonblocking coroutines (actors, streams etc.)
