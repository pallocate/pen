ID numbers:

The id numbers are a 5 byte values, roughly a thousand billion unique id:s.
The id address space is segmented into blocks to avoid conflicts between different economies.
The consumption council keeps a few prepared, ready to use id numbers available.
The "head" is a p2p shared counter that keeps track of a number of free id:s at the head of the counter.

When a new id is created. The local council looks at the head, and makes a claim of one of the available numbers.
To allow for other claims to come in and things to settle, the claim is put in the claim que for a specified number of days.
Claims after that time will not be accepted.

A hash of the claim is used to compare the claims, and the lowest hash value wins.
If a claim with lower hash value shows up, the losing council redraws it´s claim and claims another number.

The newly accepted id numbers will be kept for a while to detect conflicts.
In case of a conflict, the number should be dropped by all parties.

Statistics should be collected about conflicts, lose rates and warnings could be issued.
